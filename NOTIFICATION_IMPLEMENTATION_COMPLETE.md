# Notification System Implementation - Complete

## Overview
The booking notification system has been fully implemented and integrated with all booking CRUD operations across both staff and customer services. This document outlines the complete implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`convex/schema.ts`)

#### Added Index
- **`by_branch_role`** on `users` table: `["branch_id", "role"]`
  - Enables efficient querying of staff members by branch and role
  - Critical for notification distribution to branch staff

### 2. Notification Service Updates (`convex/services/notifications.ts`)

#### Enhanced `createNotification` Mutation
Added support for all notification fields:
- `branch_id`: Optional branch assignment for branch-scoped notifications
- `action_url`: Deep link to related content
- `action_label`: CTA button text
- `metadata`: Flexible metadata storage for notification context
- `expires_at`: Automatic notification expiration
- `recipient_id`: Now optional (for branch-wide notifications)
- `recipient_type`: Added "barber" as valid type

**Benefits:**
- Full feature parity with `bookingNotifications` service
- Supports both individual and branch-wide notifications
- Enables rich notification UI with actions

### 3. Booking Service Updates (`convex/services/bookings.ts`)

#### A. `createBooking` Mutation
**Notifications Sent:**
1. **Customer**: "Booking Received" notification
2. **Staff**: "New Booking" alert (branch-wide)
3. **Barber** (if assigned): "New Assignment" notification

#### B. `createWalkInBooking` Mutation
**Notifications Sent:**
1. **Staff**: "Walk-in Customer" alert (branch-wide)
2. **Barber** (if assigned): "New Assignment" notification

**Fixed:** Previously had no notifications

#### C. `updateBooking` Mutation
**Comprehensive notification logic for:**

##### Status Changes:
- **`pending` → `booked`**: Customer notification of status update
- **`confirmed`**: 
  - Customer: Booking confirmation
  - Staff: Confirmation alert
  - Barber: Confirmation notice
- **`cancelled`**: 
  - Customer: Cancellation notice
  - Staff: Cancellation alert
  - Barber: Appointment cancellation
- **`completed`**: 
  - Customer: Thank you message
  - Barber: Service completion confirmation

##### Reschedule Changes:
When date/time changes:
- **Customer**: Reschedule notification with new date/time
- **Staff**: Reschedule alert
- **Barber**: Updated appointment time

##### Barber Assignment Changes:
When barber is changed:
- **New Barber**: New assignment notification
- **Previous Barber**: Unassignment notification with reason
- **Customer**: Barber change notice

#### D. `deleteBooking` Mutation
**Notifications Sent:**
1. **Customer**: Cancellation notice with reason
2. **Staff**: Deletion alert
3. **Barber** (if assigned): Appointment cancellation with reason

**Fixed:** Previously had no notifications

### 4. Booking Notifications Service (`convex/services/bookingNotifications.ts`)

#### Already Implemented (No Changes Needed)
- Comprehensive notification templates for all booking events
- Multi-recipient notification distribution
- Branch-wide and individual notification support
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Metadata support for contextual information
- Automatic notification expiration

```

### Barber Journey
```
1. Assigned to Booking
   └─> "New Assignment" notification

2. Booking Confirmed

// Notifications table
.index("by_recipient", ["recipient_id"])
.index("by_recipient_type", ["recipient_type"])
.index("by_branch", ["branch_id"])
.index("by_branch_type", ["branch_id", "recipient_type"])
.index("by_recipient_read", ["recipient_id", "is_read"])
.index("by_branch_read", ["branch_id", "is_read"])
.index("by_recipient_archived", ["recipient_id", "is_archived"])
```

## Best Practices Followed

## API Usage Examples

### Creating a Booking with Notifications
```typescript
const bookingId = await ctx.runMutation(api.services.bookings.createBooking, {
  customer: customerId,
  service: serviceId,
  branch_id: branchId,
  barber: barberId,
  date: "2024-01-15",
  time: "14:00",
  status: "pending"
});
// Notifications automatically sent to customer, staff, and barber
```

### Updating Booking Status
```typescript
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.bookings.updateBooking, {
  id: bookingId,
  status: "confirmed"
});
// Automatically sends confirmation notifications to all parties
```

### Manual Notification Creation
```typescript
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notifications.createNotification, {
  title: "Custom Alert",
  message: "Your custom message here",
  type: "alert",
  priority: "high",
  recipient_id: userId,
  recipient_type: "customer",
  branch_id: branchId,
  action_url: "/bookings/123",
  action_label: "View Details",
  metadata: {
    custom_field: "custom_value"
  }
});
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Cleanup expired notifications**: Run `cleanupExpiredNotifications` periodically
2. **Monitor notification delivery**: Check logs for failed notifications
3. **Update templates**: Modify `BOOKING_NOTIFICATION_TEMPLATES` as needed

### Troubleshooting
- Check Convex dashboard for mutation errors
- Review notification logs in console
- Verify user is active and has correct role
- Confirm branch_id is correctly set

## Conclusion

The notification system is now **production-ready** and fully integrated with all booking operations. All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) properly trigger appropriate notifications to all relevant parties (customers, staff, and barbers).

The system is:
- ✅ Complete (all booking operations covered)
- ✅ Robust (error handling and fail-safe design)
- ✅ Performant (optimized indexes and queries)
- ✅ Maintainable (clear code and documentation)
- ✅ Branch-aware (respects multi-branch architecture)

No over-engineering, no unnecessary complexity—just a clean, working notification system that does exactly what it needs to do.
