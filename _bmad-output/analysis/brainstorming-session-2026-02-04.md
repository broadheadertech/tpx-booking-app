### Session Reflections

This brainstorming session successfully transformed a generic "make it like social media" request into a concrete, phased implementation plan with 62 specific features. The combination of Role Playing (understanding users), Cross-Pollination (stealing patterns), and SCAMPER (systematic transformation) ensured we designed for real customer needs while leveraging proven UX patterns.

**Key Breakthrough:** The realization that the feed should be FUNCTIONAL, not just entertaining. Every scroll should potentially lead to a booking, product purchase, or deeper engagement with a barber.
