# Brainstorming Session: AI Tools for Email Marketing

**Date:** February 3, 2026
**Topic:** AI Tools for Email Marketing Tab Enhancement
**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Session Overview

**Challenge:** The current Email Marketing tab has solid foundational features (campaigns, templates, audiences, sending, basic analytics) but lacks AI-powered intelligence for automation, personalization, and predictive insights.

**Goals:**
1. Identify AI capabilities that can enhance the existing email marketing system
2. Determine which FREE AI tools/techniques are best suited for each use case
3. Create a prioritized implementation roadmap
4. Ensure zero API costs while delivering intelligent features

**Current Email Marketing Features:**

| Category | Current Capabilities |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Campaigns** | Create, edit, delete, schedule, track status (draft/scheduled/sent/failed) |
| **Templates** | 3 templates (Marketing, Promotional, Newsletter) + Custom HTML |
| **Audiences** | All customers, New (30 days), Returning, VIP (placeholder) |
| **Sending** | EmailJS integration, progress tracking, recipient selection |
| **Analytics** | Total sent, open rate, click rate, avg revenue, campaign performance |

---

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Technical feature enhancement requiring systematic AI integration planning

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Cross-Pollination** (Creative) - Borrow AI patterns from successful email marketing platforms
2. **Morphological Analysis** (Deep) - Systematic Email Feature × AI Capability mapping
3. **Solution Matrix** (Structured) - Match use cases to specific AI tools with prioritization

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from industry inspiration (what's proven) to systematic exploration (all combinations) to actionable recommendations (specific tools and priorities).

## Implementation Details (FREE)

### 1. Subject Line Suggester

```javascript
const subjectTemplates = {
  promotional: [
    "🔥 {discount}% OFF - This {day} Only!",
    "{firstName}, your exclusive {discount}% discount awaits",
    "Don't miss out: {serviceName} at {discount}% off",
    "VIP Alert: Special offer just for you, {firstName}",
  ],
  reminder: [
    "Time for a fresh cut, {firstName}?",
    "It's been {daysSinceVisit} days - we miss you!",
    "Your hair called - it wants a trim 💇",
    "{firstName}, ready for your next look?",
  ],
  newsletter: [
    "What's new at {branchName} this month",
    "Your {month} grooming guide is here",
    "{firstName}, check out our latest styles",
  ]
}
```

### 2. Send Time Optimizer

```javascript
const getOptimalSendTime = (campaigns) => {
  const hourlyOpenRates = {}

  campaigns.forEach(c => {
    const hour = new Date(c.sent_at).getHours()
    if (!hourlyOpenRates[hour]) hourlyOpenRates[hour] = []
    hourlyOpenRates[hour].push(c.open_count / c.sent_count)
  })

  const bestHour = Object.entries(hourlyOpenRates)
    .map(([hour, rates]) => ({
      hour,
      avgRate: rates.reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0) / rates.length
    }))
    .sort((a,b) => b.avgRate - a.avgRate)[0]

  return bestHour
}
```

### 3. Churn Risk Scoring

```javascript
const calculateChurnRisk = (customer) => {
  const daysSinceVisit = (Date.now() - customer.lastVisit) / (1000*60*60*24)
  const avgVisitInterval = customer.avgDaysBetweenVisits || 30

  if (daysSinceVisit < avgVisitInterval) return { risk: 'low', score: 20 }
  if (daysSinceVisit < avgVisitInterval * 1.5) return { risk: 'medium', score: 50 }
  if (daysSinceVisit < avgVisitInterval * 2) return { risk: 'high', score: 75 }
  return { risk: 'critical', score: 95, action: 'Send win-back NOW!' }
}
```

### 4. RFM Customer Scoring

```javascript
const calculateRFM = (customer) => {
  const recencyScore = scoreRecency(customer.daysSinceVisit)
  const frequencyScore = scoreFrequency(customer.totalVisits)
  const monetaryScore = scoreMonetary(customer.totalSpent)

  const rfmScore = `${recencyScore}${frequencyScore}${monetaryScore}`

  const segments = {
    '555': 'Champions',
    '554': 'Loyal Customers',
    '544': 'Potential Loyalists',
    '511': 'New Customers',
    '155': 'Cant Lose Them',
    '111': 'Lost Customers',
  }

  return { rfmScore, segment: segments[rfmScore] || 'Regular' }
}
```

### 5. Campaign Insights Generator

```javascript
const generateInsights = (campaign, historicalAvg) => {
  const insights = []
  const openRate = campaign.open_count / campaign.sent_count * 100

  if (openRate > historicalAvg.openRate * 1.1) {
    insights.push(`📈 Great open rate! ${openRate.toFixed(1)}% is above average`)
  } else if (openRate < historicalAvg.openRate * 0.9) {
    insights.push(`📉 Open rate below average. Try different subject style.`)
  }

  return insights
}
```
