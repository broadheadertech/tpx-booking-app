# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** MASTERPAINTER
**Date:** 2026-02-17

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Virtual Card / Membership Card System for TPX Booking App
**Goals:** Explore card tiers, exclusive perks (discounts, vouchers, freebies), monetization strategies, engagement mechanics, and integration with existing wallet/points/voucher ecosystem

### Context Guidance

_TPX Booking App already has a wallet system, points/loyalty system, voucher system, and multi-branch architecture. The virtual card should complement and enhance these existing systems rather than replace them._

### Session Setup

_AI-Recommended approach selected — techniques will be tailored to the virtual card topic, focusing on business model exploration, user experience, and feature ideation._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Virtual Card / Membership Card System with focus on tiers, perks, monetization, and integration

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically examine what the virtual card should Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse against existing wallet/points/voucher systems — establishing clear differentiation
- **Cross-Pollination:** Borrow proven loyalty/membership mechanics from airlines, gaming, coffee shops, fintech, and gyms — generating 30-50+ concrete perk and tier ideas
- **Chaos Engineering:** Stress-test the card concept against worst-case scenarios (nobody buys it, customers game the system, cannibalized revenue) — revealing vulnerabilities and forcing robust design

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from differentiation (what IS the card?) → idea explosion (what perks/mechanics work?) → stress testing (what could go wrong?). The structured-creative-wild progression ensures we cover the full creative spectrum while staying grounded in business reality.

## Technique Execution Results

### SCAMPER Method

**S — Substitute:**
- **#1 Exclusive Voucher Channel:** Cardholders get a separate voucher pool — regular vouchers stay independent, card adds a "VIP shelf" alongside
- **#2 Points Multiplier Override:** Same points system, cardholders earn at 1.5x/2x/3x depending on tier — no new currency, just an accelerator
- **#3 Birthday Freebie:** Every cardholder gets one free haircut during their birthday month — tangible, memorable, gets them in the chair

**C — Combine:**
- **#4 Branch Loyalty Streak (Stamp Card):** 5+ consecutive visits at the same branch = free service. Branch decides how many stamps needed and which service is the reward
- **#5 Streak Tracker as Card Feature:** Visual progress bar/flame icon showing stamp progress — gamification loop
- **#6 Time-Pressured Streak Loop:** Stamps must be completed within a time window. Hit target → free service → reset → start again. Miss window → stamps reset to zero
- **#7 Digital Stamp Card System:** Branch configures stamps needed (6, 8, or 10), reward service, and optional time window. Strictly per-branch — visiting Branch B doesn't count toward Branch A
- **#8 Branch-Controlled Reward Configuration:** Each branch sets their own stamp program independently — new branches can set fewer stamps to attract regulars fast

**A — Adapt:**
- **#9 Grab-Style Exclusive Voucher Feed:** Dedicated "Card Perks" section. Regular users see it locked with "Get Virtual Card to unlock" — FOMO driver
- **#10 Claimable Freebie Slots:** Limited claims per month, browse and choose which perks to claim, unclaimed rotate out
- **#11 Challenge-Based Perk Unlocks:** Weekly/monthly challenges ("Book 2 services this week") → complete → voucher unlocks in claimable perks
- **#12 Claim-to-Use Mechanic:** Two-step commitment — earn the perk, then claim it (7-day expiry), then use it
- **#13 Challenge Board / Quest Log:** Visual dashboard of active challenges, progress bars, rewards — game within the app
- **#14 Branch-Created Challenges:** Branch admins create challenges from their dashboard — target slow days, push new services, drive frequency

**M — Modify:**
- **#15 Multi-Tier Card System:** Silver / Gold / Platinum with escalating perks, distinct visual designs, different multipliers
- **#16 Pay-to-Enter, Earn-to-Upgrade:** Buy Silver (one-time fee) → earn XP through activity → auto-upgrade to Gold → Platinum
- **#17 Tier Progress Tracker:** Visible XP/progress bar toward next tier — gaming level-up psychology
- **#18 Tier Retention Mechanic:** Must stay active (1 visit/month) to keep tier. Go inactive → tier drops
- **#19 Platinum Fast-Track via Premium Top-Up:** Top up wallet with large amount → instant Platinum + wallet loaded for future use
- **#20 Exclusive Lounge Access (Platinum):** Physical VIP area — visible exclusivity drives aspiration
- **#21 Dual Path to Platinum:** Grind up OR top-up shortcut — serves both customer types
- **#30 Dual Top-Up Fast-Track:** Both Gold and Platinum have top-up shortcuts at different thresholds

**P — Put to Other Uses:**
- **#22 Branch Passport / Explorer Card:** Every new branch visited gets stamped. Milestone achievements: Explorer (3), Adventurer (5), TPX Legend (all)
- **#23 Explorer Achievement Rewards:** Each milestone unlocks tangible rewards — vouchers, discounts, permanent perks
- **#24 Passport Visual on Card:** Tiny branch stamp icons on the card — visual bragging rights, shareable

**E — Eliminate:**
- **#25 Nothing Hidden, Everything Aspirational:** All tier perks visible to all cardholders — locked perks greyed out with "Upgrade to unlock." Full visibility = constant aspiration
- **#26 Zero Clutter Through Smart UI:** Rich features organized through clean navigation — tabs for Perks, Challenges, Passport, Stamps

**R — Reverse:**
- **#27 Branch-Gifted Membership:** Branch admins can gift Silver cards to top regulars — surprise and delight, retention gesture. 6-month trial, immediate first challenge activated
- **#28 Annual Membership Renewal:** Card expires after 12 months. Renewal includes free service equivalent to renewal fee — card pays for itself
- **#29 Renewal Grace Period:** 30-day frozen state after expiry. Lapse beyond → tier resets to Silver

### Cross-Pollination

**From Airlines:**
- **#31 Tier Status Badges on Profile:** Barbers see "Platinum Member" on booking — VIP treatment awareness _(kept for staff-facing, not customer-facing status)_

**From Coffee Chains:**
- **#33 Seasonal Limited-Time Perks:** _(Removed — deferred to future version)_
- **#34 Double Stamp Days:** Branches activate double-stamp events on slow days — simple traffic driver

**From Gaming:**
- **#35-36 Seasonal Refresh & Card Designs:** _(Seasonal refresh removed. Card designs kept as standalone feature)_
- **#38 Card Design Collection Gallery:** Past designs saved in collection. Milestone designs for achievements (First Platinum, TPX Legend, Anniversary)
- **#39 Shareable Card Flex:** "Share my card" generates styled image for social media — organic marketing

**From Fintech:**
- **#40 Card Anniversary Bonus:** Special bonus on membership anniversary — personal touch
- **#41 Spend Milestone Rewards:** Cumulative lifetime spend milestones (5K/10K/25K) unlock rewards — long-game engagement

**From Gyms:**
- **#42 Bring-a-Friend Pass:** 1-2 guest passes per month — friend gets cardholder discount, experiences VIP, potential conversion

### Chaos Engineering (Stress Testing)

**Attack #1 — Nobody Buys It:**
- **#43-44 Defense:** Stamp card + challenges are ENTIRELY card-exclusive. Not "slightly better" — a whole feature set unavailable to free users. Costco logic.

**Attack #2 — Stamp Card Gaming:**
- **#45-46 Defense:** Branch sets minimum service price for stamp eligibility. Transparent rule, customer knows what counts.

**Attack #3 — Top-Up Platinum Abuse:**
- **#47-48 Defense:** Tier maintenance rules apply regardless of entry path. 1 visit/month minimum or tier drops. Top-up buys entry, not a permanent pass.

**Attack #4 — Challenge Quality Control:**
- **#49-52 Defense:** AI-powered challenge templates with profit analysis. Branch picks from templates organized by goal (fill slow days, push new services, etc.). Each template shows projected revenue vs reward cost. Dynamic projections based on branch's actual data.

**Attack #5 — Renewal Drop-Off:**
- **#53-55 Defense:** Triple lock — (A) Free service worth the renewal fee, (B) Lapse resets all progress (stamps, tier, passport), (C) Renewal bonus perks. Renewal pays for itself.

**Attack #6 — Revenue Cannibalization:**
- **#56-57 Verdict:** Net positive. Card fee + guaranteed retention + increased frequency easily offsets the ~₱450/year in free perks. The card is retention insurance.

**Attack #7 — Multi-Branch Stamp Confusion:**
- **#58-59 Defense:** Smart sorting — all stamp cards visible, sorted by closest to completion first. Most exciting progress always on top.

**Attack #8 — Gifted Cards Feel Worthless:**
- **#60-61 Defense:** Gifted cards get 6-month trial with instant onboarding — first challenge active immediately. Renew at full price after trial or expires.

**Attack #9 — Seasonal Fatigue:**
- **#62-64 Resolution:** Seasonal system removed from v1. Core card has enough engagement loops. Add seasons later when there's demand.

**Final Stress Test — The Pitch:**
> "Pay once, get a free service every 6-10 visits, exclusive vouchers you earn through challenges, birthday freebie, and VIP perks as you level up — the card pays for itself after your second free stamp service."

## Final Virtual Card Blueprint

### Card Tiers

| | Silver | Gold | Platinum |
|---|--------|------|----------|
| **How to get** | Buy (low fee) | Earn OR top-up shortcut | Earn OR top-up shortcut |
| **Points multiplier** | 1.5x | 2x | 3x |
| **Exclusive vouchers** | Basic pool | Better pool | Premium pool |
| **Branch stamp card** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Challenges** | Basic rewards | More rewards | Premium rewards |
| **Birthday** | Free haircut | Free haircut | Free haircut |
| **Lounge access** | No | No | Yes |
| **Passport** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Bring-a-friend** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Card designs** | Standard | Better | Premium + milestone |

### Core Mechanics

1. **Stamp Card:** Branch-configured (stamps needed, reward service, min service price, time window). Per-branch, infinite loop reset.
2. **Challenges:** AI-powered templates with profit projections. Branch picks by goal. Challenge → Claim → Use flow.
3. **Passport:** Cross-branch explorer with achievement milestones and rewards. Smart stamp card sorting by completion progress.
4. **Tiers:** Pay to enter Silver, earn XP to level up. Top-up shortcut for Gold/Platinum. Monthly visit required to maintain tier.
5. **Renewal:** Annual, 12-month cycle. Free service on renewal. 30-day grace period. Tier/progress reset on lapse.
6. **Gifted Cards:** Branch-gifted 6-month trial with instant first challenge. Convert to paid on renewal.

### Engagement Loop

> **Buy/Get Gifted → Earn stamps + Complete challenges + Explore branches → Level up tier → Unlock better perks → Renew annually (free service) → Keep climbing**

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Thematic Organization

**Theme 1: Card Economy & Tiers** — How the card is structured, purchased, and leveled up
- Multi-tier system (Silver/Gold/Platinum), pay-to-enter with earn-to-upgrade, top-up fast-track for Gold & Platinum, tier progress XP bar, monthly activity maintenance, dual path (grind or buy)

**Theme 2: Recurring Revenue & Retention** — How the card generates ongoing business value
- Annual 12-month renewal cycle, free service on renewal (self-paying), 30-day grace period before tier reset, renewal triple lock (free service + progress loss + bonus)

**Theme 3: Branch Engagement Engine** — How branches drive traffic and revenue through the card
- Digital stamp card (branch-configured, per-branch, time-limited, infinite loop), branch-created challenges via AI templates with profit projections, double stamp days, minimum service threshold for stamps

**Theme 4: Cardholder Perks & Rewards** — What makes the card worth having
- Exclusive voucher channel (VIP shelf), points multiplier (1.5x/2x/3x), birthday free haircut, Grab-style challenge-to-claim flow, Platinum lounge access, anniversary bonus, bring-a-friend passes

**Theme 5: Gamification & Exploration** — What keeps cardholders engaged long-term
- Streak tracker visual, branch passport with explorer achievements, card design collection gallery, shareable card flex for social media, cumulative spend milestones

**Theme 6: Acquisition & Onboarding** — How customers get the card and start using it
- All tiers visible to all (aspirational design), branch-gifted 6-month trial cards, stamp card + challenges fully card-exclusive (Costco logic), instant first challenge on activation

### Prioritization Results

**Top Priority Ideas (Build First):**
1. **Card Tiers + Top-Up Fast-Track** — Foundation of the entire system. Without tiers, nothing else works.
2. **Branch Stamp Card System** — The #1 reason customers will buy the card. Tangible, simple, proven mechanic.
3. **Challenge-to-Claim System** — The ongoing engagement engine that keeps cardholders active between stamp completions.

**Quick Win Opportunities:**
1. **Points Multiplier** — Likely just a multiplier flag on the existing points system
2. **Birthday Free Haircut** — Simple date check + auto-generated voucher
3. **Tier Status Badge on Bookings** — Staff-facing label on booking records

**Breakthrough Concepts (Long-Term):**
1. **AI Challenge Templates with Profit Projections** — Branch intelligence baked into a simple template picker
2. **Branch Passport + Explorer Achievements** — Turns multi-branch into a customer adventure
3. **Self-Paying Renewal** — Eliminates the biggest churn moment by making renewal feel free

### Action Planning

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Virtual card schema (tiers, XP, status, expiry, renewal dates)

- Cardholder behavior insights for branch admins

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- 64 ideas generated across SCAMPER, Cross-Pollination, and Chaos Engineering
- Complete virtual card blueprint with 3 tiers, 6 core mechanics, and 4-phase implementation roadmap
- Every major vulnerability identified and defended through stress testing
- Clear one-sentence pitch validated: "The card pays for itself after your second free stamp service"

**Session Reflections:**
- MASTERPAINTER showed strong product instinct — consistently choosing simplicity over complexity (flat multipliers, no seasonal system for v1, AI templates over manual challenge creation)
- The stamp card + passport combination emerged as the most innovative structural decision — opposite behaviors (branch loyalty vs exploration) that create a natural customer funnel
- The self-paying renewal mechanic (#54) is the single most important retention feature — it removes the psychological barrier to annual commitment
- AI challenge templates with profit projections (#50-52) represent the biggest technical lift but also the highest business value — branch admins become their own marketing team with zero guesswork

**Creative Facilitation Narrative:**
_This session evolved from a simple "virtual card with perks" concept into a fully-designed membership club ecosystem. The breakthrough moment came during the Combine phase when MASTERPAINTER introduced the stamp card mechanic — this shifted the entire design from "discount card" to "engagement platform." The Chaos Engineering phase proved especially valuable, with every attack revealing a practical defense that strengthened the final blueprint. The concept is now stress-tested, financially validated, and ready for phased implementation._
