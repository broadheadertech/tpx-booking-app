# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** MASTERPAINTER
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Branch Admin Wallet & Product Ordering System
**Goals:**
- Branch admin wallet (top-up, balance, history)
- Product ordering from HQ catalog
- Instant wallet payment (no delays)
- Full order tracking (placed → shipped → delivered)
- Auto-stock into branch inventory on delivery
- Super admin order management & fulfillment
- Unified product catalog (super admin → branches)
- Customer wallet payments → branch admin wallet (revenue collection)
- Branch admin chooses: retain in wallet OR withdraw via settlement
- Settlement/withdrawal system for cashing out

### Session Setup

_The super admin faces delayed payments when branches order products. The proposed solution adds a branch admin wallet for instant payment, removing friction from the product ordering flow. This creates a complete financial ecosystem: customers pay → branch wallet collects → branch orders products from HQ using wallet → HQ fulfills → inventory auto-stocks._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Branch Admin Wallet & Product Ordering System with focus on financial flows, ordering workflows, and inventory integration

**Recommended Techniques:**
- **Role Playing:** Explore the system from 3 key stakeholder perspectives (Super Admin, Branch Admin, Customer) to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Morphological Analysis:** Map all system parameters (wallet operations, order states, payment methods, inventory flows) and explore combinations
- **SCAMPER:** Systematically innovate on each component through Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from empathy-driven discovery (understanding what each stakeholder truly needs) → systematic parameter mapping (ensuring nothing is missed) → structured innovation (finding creative improvements to each component).
