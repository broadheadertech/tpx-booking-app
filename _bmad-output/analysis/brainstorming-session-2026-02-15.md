# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** MASTERPAINTER
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Branch Admin Wallet & Product Ordering System
**Goals:**
- Branch admin wallet (top-up, balance, history)
- Product ordering from HQ catalog
- Instant wallet payment (no delays)
- Full order tracking (placed → shipped → delivered)
- Auto-stock into branch inventory on delivery
- Super admin order management & fulfillment
- Unified product catalog (super admin → branches)
- Customer wallet payments → branch admin wallet (revenue collection)
- Branch admin chooses: retain in wallet OR withdraw via settlement
- Settlement/withdrawal system for cashing out

### Session Setup

_The super admin faces delayed payments when branches order products. The proposed solution adds a branch admin wallet for instant payment, removing friction from the product ordering flow. This creates a complete financial ecosystem: customers pay → branch wallet collects → branch orders products from HQ using wallet → HQ fulfills → inventory auto-stocks._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Branch Admin Wallet & Product Ordering System with focus on financial flows, ordering workflows, and inventory integration

**Recommended Techniques:**
- **Role Playing:** Explore the system from 3 key stakeholder perspectives (Super Admin, Branch Admin, Customer) to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Morphological Analysis:** Map all system parameters (wallet operations, order states, payment methods, inventory flows) and explore combinations
- **SCAMPER:** Systematically innovate on each component through Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from empathy-driven discovery (understanding what each stakeholder truly needs) → systematic parameter mapping (ensuring nothing is missed) → structured innovation (finding creative improvements to each component).

## Technique Execution Results

### Phase 1: Role Playing (Ideas #1-31)

**Perspective 1: Super Admin (HQ Owner)**

| # | Title | Concept | Novelty |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Instant Payment, Instant Fulfillment | When branch wallet is pre-funded, the entire order-to-ship pipeline becomes frictionless — no credit checks, no payment chasing, no delays | Shifts from trust-based credit model to prepaid commerce model |
| 2 | Advance Product Stocking | Funds are guaranteed so super admin can proactively push new products to branches | Transforms reactive ordering to proactive distribution |
| 3 | Ship-and-Monitor Only | Super admin role simplifies — no more collections or credit negotiations. Pure logistics operator | Removes the "finance department" hat entirely |
| 4 | Dynamic Credit Limits Based on Order Context | Credit evaluation tied to what is being ordered, not a flat limit | Most systems use static limits — this is contextual |
| 5 | Branch Trust Meter System | Trust score builds over time based on branch behavior — timely top-ups, payment history, order fulfillment | Reputation layer for B2B supply chain, gamifies good behavior |
| 6 | Super Admin Discretionary Override | Trust meter advises, but super admin retains final say on credit decisions | Balances automation with human judgment |
| 7 | Trust Tier Rewards | High trust scores unlock perks — priority shipping, early product access, better credit terms | Turns payment problem into competitive advantage |
| 8 | Wallet Hold / Escrow on Order Placement | Order amount placed on hold, not deducted. Branch sees available vs. held balance | Mirrors credit card authorization for internal B2B |
| 9 | Shipment Confirmation Triggers Status Update | Logistics confirms shipment with tracking, carrier, ETA. Updates system-wide | Three-party verification: Super Admin → Logistics → Branch |
| 10 | Wallet Deduction Only on Confirmed Delivery | Hold released to payment only when logistics AND branch confirm receipt | Smart contract pattern without blockchain |
| 11 | Full Order Lifecycle Visibility | Status trail: Placed → Payment Held → Shipped → In Transit → Delivered → Received → Payment Released | Total transparency eliminates trust issues |
| 12 | Hold Timeout / Cancellation Rules | Hold expires after set days if not shipped. Branch can cancel if delivery overdue | Protects branch from funds locked indefinitely |

**Perspective 2: Branch Admin**

| # | Title | Concept | Novelty |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 13 | Personalized Morning Briefing | AI-generated daily briefing — what to expect today, tailored to the specific branch | Interprets data FOR the admin instead of showing raw numbers |
| 14 | Recent Activity Digest | AI summarizes yesterday's sales, sign-ups, pending orders in natural language | Conversational summary that respects time |
| 15 | Low Stock Detection with Auto-Order | System monitors levels and can auto-order when below threshold (opt-in) | Eliminates stockouts proactively |
| 16 | Auto Top-Up Based on Historical Patterns (Opt-In) | Learns top-up patterns, suggests/triggers top-up when balance drops. Always optional | Removes cognitive load of wallet management |
| 17 | Daily Customer Forecast | Predicts expected customer count based on historical data, day of week, patterns | Data-driven staffing instead of gut feeling |
| 18 | Peak Time Prediction | Identifies today's expected peak hours for break scheduling and prep | Proactive preparation vs. reactive management |
| 19 | AI Action Recommendations | AI recommends actions for every problem — low stock: "order now", slow day: "run a promo" | Decision-support system, not just information display |
| 20 | Customer Payment Routing Decision | Branch admin chooses per transaction: route to wallet (for orders) or settlement (for withdrawal) | Conscious control over cash flow strategy |
| 21 | One-Way Branch Wallet — No Withdrawal | Once in wallet, committed to business. Can only be used for HQ orders | Self-imposed financial discipline tool |
| 22 | Flexible Settlement — Partial or Whole | Settle any amount — full balance, partial, or specific transactions | Maximum flexibility without complexity |
| 23 | Revenue Split Visualization | Visual flow showing incoming payments splitting into wallet vs. settlement with historical patterns | Makes branch admin financially self-aware |
| 24 | Settlement Processing & Timing | Clear settlement options with transparent processing times | Trust defined by withdrawal reliability |
| 25 | AI Revenue Split Recommendations | AI recommends optimal split based on upcoming orders, stock needs, wallet balance | Turns every branch admin into financially smart operator |
| 26 | Predictive Cash Flow Advisory | AI looks ahead — warns if settling too much will prevent next order | Prevents "took too much profit, can't order stock" |
| 27 | Smart Settlement Timing | AI balances business needs AND personal cash needs of the admin | Respects that admin is also a person with bills |

**Perspective 3: Customer**

| # | Title | Concept | Novelty |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 28 | Cashless Confidence | Wallet makes payment invisible — walk in, get serviced, tap pay, walk out | Shifts barbershop from cash-heavy to digital-first |
| 29 | Always-Ready Balance | Pre-load anytime. By the time they sit down, payment is handled | Psychology shifts from transactional to membership |
| 30 | Wallet Balance Visibility During Service | See balance while barber recommends add-ons. Removes price anxiety | Empowered upselling without awkwardness |
| 31 | Customer Auto Top-Up (Opt-In) | Set minimum balance, auto-load from GCash/bank. Never think about loading again | Subscription to convenience |

### Phase 2: Morphological Analysis (Ideas #32-46)

**Parameter Matrix:**
- P1: Money Entry Points (7 options)
- P2: Money States (7 options)
- P3: Order Triggers (6 options)
- P4: Order Lifecycle States (9 options)
- P5: Inventory Actions (6 options)
- P6: Settlement & Withdrawal (6 options)

**Cross-Parameter Discoveries:**

| # | Title | Concept | Novelty |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 32 | Auto-Order + Escrow + Auto Top-Up Chain | Low stock → auto-order → wallet hold → auto top-up funds it → super admin ships. Zero human intervention | Fully autonomous supply chain loop |
| 33 | Customer Demand Signal + AI Restock | Fast-selling products trigger AI restock recommendation BEFORE stockout | Demand-driven ordering, not schedule-driven |
| 34 | Branch-to-Branch Transfer | Low stock at Branch A, excess at Branch B → lateral transfer with wallet-to-wallet payment | Branch network effect, faster than HQ ordering |
| 35 | Auto Top-Up Corrected to Opt-In Only | Auto top-up NEVER on by default. User discovers, opts in, sets limits, can disable anytime | Respects financial autonomy — trust through restraint |
| 36 | HQ Stock Level Visibility | Branches see HQ available stock in real time before ordering | Eliminates blind ordering frustration |
| 37 | First Come First Served Queue | Limited stock fulfilled chronologically. Escrow hold secures queue position | Fair transparent allocation, no favoritism |

| 39 | Partial Fulfillment with Split Delivery | Ship what's available now, backorder the rest. Escrow adjusted accordingly | Business keeps moving vs. all-or-nothing |
| 40 | Damage Report with Photo Evidence | Take photos in-app, tag damaged items, create instant claim with visual proof | No "he said she said" — photographic evidence |
| 41 | Escrow Protection on Damaged Goods | Damaged items not confirmed → that portion stays in escrow → released back to wallet | Escrow model naturally handles damage |
| 42 | Damage Resolution Options | Super admin chooses: ship replacement, issue wallet credit, or arrange return pickup | Multiple paths because not every situation is the same |
| 43 | Damaged Goods Don't Enter Inventory | Items marked damaged never auto-stock. Only confirmed-good items enter inventory | Prevents phantom stock on shelves |
| 44 | No Trust-Based Stock Priority | Stock allocation is ALWAYS first-come-first-served. Trust meter only for credit | Keeps ecosystem healthy for new and veteran branches |
| 45 | Equal Restock Notification — All at Once | Every branch notified simultaneously on restock. No early access for anyone | Equal opportunity, speed of decision is the differentiator |
| 46 | Restock Notification with Stock Count | Include available units in notification so branches assess urgency | Informed urgency instead of blind panic |

### Phase 3: SCAMPER (Ideas #47-72)

| # | Letter | Title | Concept | Novelty |

| 51 | C | Combined Order + Inventory View | Inventory screen IS the ordering interface. See stock + reorder button side by side | Removes navigation — see low stock, order immediately |
| 52 | C | Combined Receipt + Inventory Update | One tap "Received" → inventory updated + payment released + order closed simultaneously | Three backend processes from single user action |
| 53 | C | Wallet Top-Up + Loyalty Rewards | Loading wallet earns bonus credit or loyalty points. "Load P1,000, get P50 bonus" | Wallet adoption AND retention in one action |
| 54 | C | Email Notifications Across All Events | Every critical action triggers email to relevant party. Complete paper trail | System's voice outside the app |
| 55 | C | Role-Based Email Digests | Same event, different email per role. Order placed → branch gets confirmation, super admin gets fulfillment task | Everyone informed at their level of concern |
| 56 | C | AI Morning Briefing via Email | Daily AI briefing sent before shop opens. Read on phone over coffee | Informed before app is even opened |

| 66 | P | Order History as HQ Demand Forecasting | Aggregated branch orders inform HQ purchasing from suppliers | Two-way intelligence pipeline up the supply chain |
| 67 | P | Customer Payment Data as Product Insights | Which products pair with which services? Transaction data is market research | Every transaction teaches the system what sells |

## Session Summary and Insights

### Key Achievements
- **72 breakthrough ideas** generated across 3 creative techniques
- **8 organized themes** covering every aspect of the wallet-ordering ecosystem
- **20 prioritized concepts** across 4 implementation tiers
- **Complete financial loop** designed: Customer → Branch Wallet → HQ → Inventory → Customer

### System Design Principles Discovered
1. **Consent over convenience** — Auto features always opt-in, never forced
2. **Transparency over trust** — Everyone sees everything relevant to them
3. **Fairness over favoritism** — Stock allocation is always equal access
4. **Protection through escrow** — Money only moves on confirmed delivery
5. **AI advises, human decides** — Recommendations, never automated decisions on money

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

_This session revealed a deeply thoughtful approach to financial system design. MASTERPAINTER consistently prioritized fairness (rejecting trust-based stock priority), user autonomy (making auto top-up opt-in), and real-world pragmatism (working hours settlement, super admin-controlled minimums). The escrow model emerged as the cornerstone innovation — a single mechanism that solves payment disputes, damage handling, and trust issues simultaneously. The AI branch operations layer (morning briefing, forecasting, recommendations) emerged organically from the branch admin perspective and represents a significant value-add beyond the core wallet/ordering system._

### Breakthrough Moments
- **Escrow model** — Naturally handles disputes, damage, and trust in one mechanism
- **One-way wallet** — Brilliant financial discipline that separates operating funds from profit
- **AI morning briefing** — Transforms the app from a tool to a business partner
- **Equal restock notifications** — Principled rejection of favoritism in supply chain
- **Revenue routing choice** — Giving branch admins conscious control over every peso
