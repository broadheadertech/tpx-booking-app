# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** MASTERPAINTER
**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Barber Earnings Tab enhancements - goal tracking, motivation, and performance insights
**Goals:** Features that help barbers track progress toward income goals, stay motivated, and gain actionable earning insights

### Session Setup

_The barber dashboard Earnings tab currently shows payroll-aligned earnings data (commission breakdown, daily rate, service/product commissions, fees). The goal is to brainstorm features that make this tab more actionable and motivating - helping barbers understand where they stand, what they need to do to hit targets, and stay driven throughout the pay period._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Barber Earnings Tab enhancements with focus on goal tracking, motivation, and performance insights

**Recommended Techniques:**
- **Role Playing:** Embody barber perspectives to uncover real daily pain points and desires
- **SCAMPER:** Systematically transform the existing Earnings Tab through 7 lenses
- **Cross-Pollination:** Borrow patterns from fitness, gaming, and gig-economy apps

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Role Playing (Barber Perspectives)

**Interactive Focus:** Understanding what barbers actually need from their earnings view
**Key Breakthroughs:** Barbers are service-based earners who think in "cuts" not pesos; they want to know "how many more haircuts to hit my goal"
**User Creative Strengths:** Strong domain knowledge of barber workflows and motivations

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Weekly Earnings Goal Setting** - Barber self-sets a weekly PHP target (e.g., 15,000)
2. **Daily Scoreboard - 3 Numbers** - Cuts made today / Earnings today / Products sold today
3. **AI Pace Calculator** - Uses personal history to calculate needed daily pace to hit weekly goal
4. **Gap Translator** - Converts remaining PHP gap into concrete service counts ("12 haircuts to go")
5. **Pace Comparison - Yesterday vs Today** - Side-by-side momentum indicator
6. **Earnings Coach Tips** - Contextual data-driven tips ("Fridays are your strongest day - push for 2 extra cuts")
7. **Product Upsell Nudge** - Connects product sales to goal progress ("3 pomade sales = PHP 450 closer")

### Technique 2: SCAMPER (Transforming the Existing Tab)

**Building on Previous:** Took existing earnings display and transformed through SCAMPER lenses
**New Insights:** The UI should be "simple ring first, detail on demand" - not overwhelming
**Developed Ideas:** Progress visualization should fuse goal tracking with daily stats

**Ideas Generated:**
8. **Progress Ring + Coin Stack Hero** - Animated ring showing % toward goal with stacking coins/bills visual
9. **Ring + Scoreboard Fusion** - Progress ring center shows today's 3 key numbers
10. **Weekly Ring with Daily Segments** - Ring divided into 7 segments showing each day's contribution
11. **Triple Ring (Apple Watch style)** - 3 nested rings: Services / Products / Overall Goal
12. **Simple Ring → Tap to Expand** - Minimal ring on main UI, tap reveals full breakdown detail
13. **Time-Aware Earnings Display** - Shows earnings relative to time of day ("Ahead of pace for 2pm")
14. **Weekly Streak Bar** - Duolingo-style dots showing goal-hit days (Mon-Sun)
15. **Collapsible Commission Details** - Commission breakdown hidden by default, expandable
16. **Goal-First Layout** - Reorder tab: Goal progress at top, existing details below

### Technique 3: Cross-Pollination (Fitness/Gaming/Gig Economy Patterns)

**Building on Previous:** Borrowed motivation patterns from Duolingo, Apple Watch, Grab Driver
**New Insights:** Gamification elements keep barbers engaged without being childish
**Developed Ideas:** Personal records and level systems create long-term engagement

**Ideas Generated:**
17. **Animated Earnings Pop** - Celebratory animation when a service completes and earnings update
18. **Milestone Checkpoints** - 25% / 50% / 75% / 100% goal milestones with badge unlocks
19. **Personal Records Card** - "Best day ever: PHP 5,200" — tracks and celebrates personal bests
20. **Quick Stat Pills** - Tappable horizontal pills: Cuts, Earnings, Products, Tips
21. **Weekly Level System** - Bronze → Silver → Gold → Diamond based on weekly goal achievement %

**Creative Facilitation Narrative:**
_This session revealed that the most impactful Earnings Tab features are those that translate abstract financial data into the barber's native language — services completed. The Progress Ring concept emerged as the centerpiece, with AI coaching providing the "how to get there" intelligence. The user's domain expertise drove the session toward practical, service-based metrics rather than purely financial displays._
