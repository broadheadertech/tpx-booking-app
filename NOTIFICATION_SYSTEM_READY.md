## 🎯 Notification Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
All notifications are **automatically triggered** by these events:

1. **Booking Creation** → Sends confirmation to customer, alert to staff, assignment to barber
2. **Booking Update** → Sends reschedule notification if date/time changed
3. **Booking Cancellation** → Notifies customer, staff, and assigned barber
4. **Payment Completion** → Sends receipt to customer, alert to staff
5. **Payment Failure** → Alerts staff about payment issues
6. **POS Transaction** → Notifies customer (if registered) and staff

### Scheduled Triggers
Run these mutations periodically (recommended via cron job or Convex scheduled functions):

```javascript
// Run daily at 9 AM
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notificationScheduler.sendBookingReminders, {});
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notificationScheduler.sendDailySchedules, {});

// Run every 15 minutes during business hours
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notificationScheduler.sendCheckInReminders, {});

// Run daily at midnight
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notificationScheduler.resetDailyReminderFlags, {});

// Run weekly
await ctx.runMutation(api.services.notificationScheduler.cleanupOldNotifications, {});
```
