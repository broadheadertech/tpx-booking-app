ðŸ“˜ Multi-Branch Expansion Plan
1. New branches Table
{
  branch_code: string,   // unique short code, e.g. "MNL01"
  name: string,          // branch name
  address: string,
  phone?: string,
  email?: string,
  is_active: boolean,
  createdAt: number,
  updatedAt: number
}

Relationships

users.branch_id â†’ staff, barbers, branch admins are tied to a branch

bookings.branch_id â†’ all bookings are scoped to one branch

transactions.branch_id â†’ POS & sales scoped to branch

services.branch_id â†’ each branch can customize its catalog

2. Role Hierarchy

Super Admin â†’ Can create branches, assign branch admins, view all branches.

Branch Admin â†’ Full control of one branch (staff, barbers, services, reports).

Staff â†’ Bookings, POS, and customer service in assigned branch.

Barber â†’ Schedule & assigned bookings only.

Customer â†’ Select branch during booking.

3. Flowcharts

4. Database Diagram (Simplified)
erDiagram
    BRANCHES ||--o{ USERS : "branch_id"
    BRANCHES ||--o{ SERVICES : "branch_id"
    BRANCHES ||--o{ BOOKINGS : "branch_id"
    BRANCHES ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "branch_id"

    USERS ||--o{ BOOKINGS : "customer_id"
    USERS ||--o{ BOOKINGS : "barber_id"
    USERS ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "processed_by"

5. Minimal API Adjustments

All queries & mutations should filter by branch_id.

Example:

// Get bookings for a branch
getBookingsByBranch(branchId: Id<"branches">) â†’ Booking[]


Staff/Admin dashboards should load data only for their branch.

Super Admin dashboards can aggregate across branches.

6. Documentation Update

Add branch_id to all core entities (users, bookings, transactions, services).

Add branch selection screen for customers.

Add branch-scoped dashboards for admins.

Super Admin has global dashboard across all branches.

âœ… This design keeps your current setup intact but adds a clean branch_id filter across all tables.
âœ… No microservices or overcomplication â€” just one extra table and one extra field.
âœ… Future-proof: You can later add revenue comparisons across branches, centralized analytics, and even multi-tenant hosting if needed.
